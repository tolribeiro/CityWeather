CityWeather
===================
**CityWeather** is an iOS app written in Objective-C that allows the user to add a pin to the map and search for cities around that location to check on weather conditions. As soon as the user adds the pin, the address shows up in the bottom.

By making use of the *OpenWeather* API, when the user chooses one of the listed cities to see more details, the app searches and lists cities close to that point and provides temperature, description for the weather and an icon that represents that condition.
